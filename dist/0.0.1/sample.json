However, people of Reddy community force evicted Dalits from their land and encroached it. Dalits were farming on that land. Since then, Dalits have been fighting to regain their land. They are supported by All India Agricultural Workers Union and have given representations to local authorities including district collector. Under AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act 1977, the assigned lands cannot be sold or purchased.",
